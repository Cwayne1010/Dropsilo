> **Relevance to this topic**: TEE deployment (AWS Nitro, on-prem Intel SGX) is the near-term confidential computing attachment point for the Dify inference layer. On-prem hardware infrastructure and TEE adoption are complementary — on-prem + TEE produces the strongest possible privacy guarantee and aligns with Dropsilo's existing hardware direction.
