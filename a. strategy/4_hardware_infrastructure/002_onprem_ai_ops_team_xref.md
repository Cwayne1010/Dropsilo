# Building a Dedicated Ops Team for an On-Prem AI/LLM Platform (Cross-Reference)

> **Primary location**: `4_hardware_infrastructure/equipment/001_onprem_ai_ops_team.md`
> **Relevance to this topic**: Contains detailed cost breakdowns across four ops models — managed GPU rack ($1-3k/mo vendor), cloud/hybrid ($0.10-0.20/GPU-hr + $1.5-3k upfront), outsourced ops ($10-25k/mo), and full DIY (<$3k). Also includes a cloud-vs-on-prem decision matrix comparing CAPEX amortization (5-7 yr) against OPEX variability.
