> **Relevance to this topic**: The competitive analysis directly informs Dropsilo's product positioning — the "Speed vs. Truth" distinction vs. Covecta, the whitespace in Jack Henry-native data fabric, and the architectural decisions (data-first vs. workflow-first) that create defensibility. Product architecture choices should be made with this competitive context in mind.
