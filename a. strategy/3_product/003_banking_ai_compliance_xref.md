# Banking AI Compliance Stack (Cross-Reference)

> **Primary location**: `1_centralized_database/003_banking_ai_compliance_stack.md`
> **Relevance to this topic**: The compliance stack (SR 11-7, GLBA, FFIEC, BSA/AML) maps directly onto each layer of Dropsilo's product architecture — dbt documentation satisfies SR 11-7 model inventory, Snowflake native features satisfy GLBA encryption, and the Dify layer requires the highest compliance attention for model risk. Compliance is not a post-build add-on; it is baked into the product architecture.
