# Methodology — Research Index

> Last updated: 2026-02-12

## Summary
This folder covers data methodology — how customer and financial data is structured, governed, and made consistent across departments. The Dropsilo technical framework (cross-referenced here) establishes the core methodology: a unified data fabric with semantic layering via dbt that ensures metrics like "Total Exposure" and "Customer Health" are calculated once and presented through role-specific Logic Views.
