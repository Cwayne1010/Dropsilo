# Unified Multi-Modal Data Architecture & Enterprise LLM Isolation (Cross-Reference)

> **Primary location**: `3_product/005_unified_multimodal_data_and_llm_isolation.md`
> **Relevance to this topic**: Directly extends the compliance stack (003) and data architecture methodology — covers how Snowflake Cortex Search unifies structured and unstructured data under the same RBAC and audit model, and how enterprise LLM deployment (AWS Bedrock) satisfies FFIEC vendor risk, GLBA data residency, and SR 11-7 model boundary requirements. The multi-tenant isolation architecture (per-bank Snowflake role + Dify workspace + namespaced RAG) is the operational implementation of the compliance principles documented in entry 003.
