# Business Model — Research Index

> Last updated: 2026-02-17

## Summary
Research covers lean ops team structuring for a two-person AI startup (entry 001, xref) and the competitive landscape for community bank AI (entry 002). The competitive analysis reveals genuine whitespace: no purpose-built Jack Henry-native + data fabric + AI + NLQ product exists for community banks. The nearest threat is Covecta (workflow automation SaaS, $6.5M funded, b1BANK deal Feb 2026) — but they automate on top of fragmented data rather than unifying the foundation. Dropsilo's positioning: "Speed vs. Truth." Core risk: Jack Henry building this themselves long-term, or Covecta hiring into data engineering.

## Execution Candidates
- Competitor monitoring scraper — weekly digest of competitor press releases, funding announcements, job postings

## Task Recommendations

| Task | Priority | Source Entry | Status |
|------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Research Covecta's Jack Henry integration approach — jXchange access or surface-level API? | HIGH | 002 | recommended |
| Monitor Covecta job postings for "data engineer" / "data warehouse" hires | MED | 002 | recommended |
| Identify 3-5 community banks that have publicly complained about Jack Henry analytics | MED | 002 | recommended |

## Notes
- Covecta landed b1BANK ($8.2B community bank) on Feb 17 2026 — same day as this research. Market is moving.
- "Speed vs. Truth" is the core positioning frame: Covecta sells weeks-to-ROI, Dropsilo sells a governed data foundation that compounds in value over time.
- Subfolders (branding_risk_analysis, implement_price_vs_recurring, network, outreach_pitch) may have their own `_index.md` files.
