### Recommended Build Sequence

The key insight: **freelance on the skills you need for Dropsilo**. This creates a virtuous cycle.

1. **Immediate (Week 1-2):** Market Tier 3 skills (n8n, scraping, Google automation) — you already have working code to show as portfolio pieces (appraisal workflow, lead gen pipeline)
2. **Short-term (Month 1-2):** Take on AI agent and workflow automation gigs (Tier 1, #1) — every agent you build sharpens your orchestration instincts for Dropsilo
3. **Medium-term (Month 2-4):** Layer in data engineering gigs (Tier 1, #2) — Snowflake + dbt projects build the exact skills for the data fabric
4. **Ongoing:** Banking/FinTech domain knowledge (Tier 2, #5) compounds over time — position yourself as a specialist, not a generalist

## Context & Analysis
This analysis sits at the intersection of product strategy and revenue generation. The Dropsilo vision requires mastery across data engineering, AI orchestration, banking domain knowledge, and enterprise integration. Every one of these skills maps directly to high-demand freelance categories.

The strategic advantage: unlike freelancers who learn skills in isolation, building these capabilities in service of a unified product vision creates compounding expertise. A Snowflake gig isn't just a gig — it's practice for the data fabric. An AI agent project isn't just a project — it's rehearsal for Layer 2 orchestration.

The Tier 3 skills (n8n, scraping, Google automation) are the quickest path to revenue because working code already exists in the workspace. The appraisal order workflow and lead gen pipeline serve as portfolio pieces.

## Cross-References
- Relates to: `3_product/centralized_database_interfaces/` — the technical framework defines which capabilities are needed
- Relates to: `1_centralized_database/jack_henry/` — API integration skills map directly to jXchange work
